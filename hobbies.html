  <p> I love to travel and explore new places. In my spare time you would often find me engrossed in a novel. Some of my favourite works are: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20873740-sapiens">Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25899336-when-breath-becomes-air">When breath becomes air</a> .
  I am a trained <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathak">Kathak</a> dancer and like to play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump_organ">Harmonium</a>.

I have completed a basic course in Spanish. Fluent in English, Hindi and Marathi, I like to read about languages and know different pecularities of a language.
